## **Suggested meaning**

Designates that an API item's release stage is "alpha". It is intended to be used by third-party developers eventually, but has not yet been released. The tooling may trim the declaration from a public release.

## **Example**

```
/**
 * Represents a book in the catalog.
 * @public
 */
export class Book {
  /**
   * The title of the book.
   * @alpha
   */
  public get title(): string;

  /**
   * The author of the book.
   */
  public get author(): string;
}

```

In this example, `Book.author` inherits its `@public` designation from the containing class, whereas `Book.title` is marked as "alpha".
